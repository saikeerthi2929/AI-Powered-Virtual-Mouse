# AI-Powered-Virtual-Mouse
Imagine controlling your computer without touching the mouse—just using hand gestures! 🤯 I built an AI-powered virtual mouse that lets you move the cursor, click, and interact with your screen using only your hand!
🎯 What It Does:
✅ Move the cursor by pointing your index finger ✨
✅ Click by bringing your thumb & index finger close 🔥
✅ Hands-free interaction for accessibility & gaming 🎮

🛠 Tech Used: OpenCV 🎥 | Mediapipe 🖐️ | Python 🐍 | PyAutoGUI 🖥️

💡 Why is this exciting?
This project can be used for:
✅ Touchless PC interactions (ideal for hygiene-sensitive environments)
✅ Assistive technology for people with disabilities
✅ Gesture-based gaming & smart home control
